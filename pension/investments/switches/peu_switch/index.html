<h2><a name="1"></a><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This module allows you to switch a member (or group of members) investments from one
set of investment funds to another. It allows the option of one to many, many to many
or many to one with regard to switching from old fund(s) to new fund(s).</p>

<p>You can also take expenses off switches that a member makes. Further details on how
to setup switch expenses can be found <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#swexp">here</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="monetary_amount"></a>Switches Based On A Monetary Amount</h2>

<p>If a request to switch funds based on a monetary amount is to be processed, it is <strong>imperative</strong> that
the current unit sell price for that fund is ascertained and that is then used to
determine the number of units to sell for the member. If the unit sell price drops
between this time and the time of actual sale, the administrator should be aware that
they will not realise the full amount required and vice-versa if the unit price increases
in the meantime.</p>

<p>It may be possible (and indeed desirable) for the scheme to have an agreement with
their investment funds to sell units by telephone instruction at a sell price agreed
in the phone call. This would then guarantee the correct amount would be realised
for the sale.</p>

<p>It is anticipated that this method of sale would be more suited to the insurance company
in-house managed scheme where the unit sell prices are known in advance.</p>

<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overvew Of The Switch Process</h2>

<h3>Stage 1 - Input the switch</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Use the ‘Add’ option to select the members you wish to apply the switch to.</li>
  <li>Establish basic switch details such as date instruction received and any expenses to be taken in respect of the switch.</li>
  <li>Establish what fund(s) to sell from and how much to sell. Sale method can be one of:
    <ul>
      <li>Monetary amount</li>
      <li>Percentage of units</li>
      <li>Number of units</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Now we must indicate where the proceeds from the switch are to be re-invested. This
is done by entering a list of fund code(s) and percentage(s). The total of the percentage
column must be 100% across all funds to switch into.</li>
  <li>A unit sale report is then produced showing the number of units to sell for each fund
concerned, each fund starting on a new page. The report has a summary section at the
end and an option to print just the summary section is available. Send this printout (plus perhaps a covering letter) to each fund concerned requesting
the sale of the requisite number of units.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stage 2 - Sell Units From Old Fund(s)</h3>

<p>The old fund(s) will inform us of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>number of units sold</li>
  <li>sale date</li>
  <li>unit price at which the units were sold</li>
  <li>sale proceeds value</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the ‘Sell’ option to enter the sale date and value realised for each fund(s) to
switch out of.</p>

<p>Pension Master will then calculate each members share of the sale proceeds value.
This is the amount each member has available to invest in the new fund(s). Any switch
expenses are taken off the amounts (as appropriate) before sending the money to the
new investment funds.</p>

<h3>Stage 3 - Sell From All Old Fund(s)</h3>

<p>Repeat stage 2 above until we have received and input the proceeds from <strong>all</strong> old
fund(s). The switch process as far as Pension Master is concerned is now finished.</p>

<h3>Stage 4 - Re-Invest Proceeds</h3>

<p>Each members sale proceeds are split up between the new fund(s). A cheque for the
total amount for each new fund(s) will be sent to each respective new investment fund(s).</p>

<p>The new investment history entries against the new funds just become normal un-allocated
contributions and can be picked up from here in the same way as normal un-allocated
contributions.</p>
