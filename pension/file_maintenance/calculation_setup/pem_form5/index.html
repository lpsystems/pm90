<h2><a name="01"></a>post_88_gmp_death(p,a,r,e,m,o)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the post_88_gmp_death function to calculate the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
accrued after 6 April 1988, revalued to date of death.</p>

<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>post_88_gmp_death(p,a,r,e,m,o)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>p - is a single character field that denotes the type of GMP revaluation as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>L - Limited rate revaluation</li>
      <li>F - Fixed rate revaluation</li>
      <li>S - Section 148 orders. These are assumed to be the same as for Fixed Rate revaluation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to include any transferred-in GMP in the GMP calculations</li>
  <li>r - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to include an additional revaluation year in the GMP calculations.</li>
  <li>e - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to use equalisation when calculating female SPA.</li>
  <li>m - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to use equalisation when calculating male SPA.</li>
  <li>o - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. When set to ‘Y’ it switches the calculation to use the opposite sex.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Date of death is taken as the current calculation date.</li>
  <li>If Date Left on the Member Basic Details screen is blank, it is assumed that you wish
to calculate a death in service GMP. Otherwise it is assumed it will be a death in
deferment GMP.</li>
  <li>If date of death is later than State Pension Date then the GMP is revalued up to State
Pension Date using Fixed, Limited or Section 148 orders, and between State Pension
Date and Normal Retirement Date at 1/7% per week, providing the period between State
Pension Date and Normal Pension Date is at least seven weeks.</li>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>For females with a State Pension Date of 65, the legislation says that to calculate
GMP’s you should assume a notional State Pension Date of 60 and then anything after
age 60 is classified as a late retirement for GMP purposes i.e. the post 88 portion
attracts 3% (or RPI if lower) increases each 5th April and the 1/7% per week late
retirement increases also apply.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>If Normal Retirement Date is later than State Pension Date then the GMP is revalued
up to State Pension Date using Fixed, Limited or Section 148 orders, and between State
Pension Date and Normal Retirement Date at 1/7% per week, providing the period between
State Pension Date and Normal Retirement Date is at least seven weeks.</li>

<h2><a name="11"></a>pre_88_gmp_spd(p,a,r,e,m)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the pre_88_gmp_spd function to calculate the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
accrued prior to 6 April 1988, revalued to State Pension Age.</p>

<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>pre_88_gmp_spd(p,a,r,e,m)
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>p - is a single character field that denotes the type of GMP revaluation as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>L - Limited rate revaluation</li>
      <li>F - Fixed rate revaluation</li>
      <li>S - Section 148 orders. These are assumed to be the same as for Fixed Rate revaluation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to include any transferred-in GMP in the GMP calculations</li>
  <li>r - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to include an additional revaluation year in the GMP calculations.</li>
  <li>e - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to use equalisation when calculating female SPA.</li>
  <li>m - is a single character field that takes the value ‘Y’ or ‘N’. It denotes whether to use equalisation when calculating male SPA.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>For females with a State Pension Date of 65, the legislation says that to calculate
GMP’s you should assume a notional State Pension Date of 60 and then anything after
age 60 is classified as a late retirement for GMP purposes i.e. the post 88 portion
attracts 3% (or RPI if lower) increases each 5th April and the 1/7% per week late
retirement increases also apply.</li>
</ol>
