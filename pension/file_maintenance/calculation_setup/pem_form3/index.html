<h2><a name="01"></a>$table_code(date)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the $ symbol to refer to a particular actuarial factor table in your formula.
This looks up the factor table at age nearest birthday. The argument is used to find
the factor table that was effective at that date.</p>

<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>$table_code(date) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>date - is the effective date for the Factor Table. If no table exists at this date then the previous table will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are unsure of the factor table required and you have already entered the $
part of the formula line, click the lookup icon for a list of the factor tables available.</li>
  <li>The member’s age and sex determine which factor is to be applied. A member’s age is
calculated by subtracting his/her date of birth from the quotation date (which is
entered by the user, and which is defaulted to today’s date).</li>
  <li>This table lookup interpolates between two factors if a member’s birthday does not
fall exactly on the quotation date. e.g. $ER000 will extract a certain factor from
table ER000, depending on a member’s age and sex.</li>
  <li>The date argument can be set to TODAY. This will then use the most recent actuarial factor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<pre><code>$00001(TODAY)
$00001(20020101)
</code></pre>

<p>The first example refers to factor table 00001. The factor table used will be the one dated on or before today’s date.</p>

<p>The second example refers to factor table 00001. The factor table used will be the one dated on or before 01/01/2002.</p>

<h2><a name="02"></a>$$table_code(date)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the $$ symbol to refer to a particular actuarial factor table in your formula.
This looks up the factor table at age next birthday. The argument is used to find
the factor table that was effective at that date.</p>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>date - is the effective date for the Factor Table. If no table exists at this date then the previous table will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>$$table_code(date) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>If you are unsure of the factor table require and you have already entered the $$
part of the formula line, click the lookup icon to see a list of factor tables.</li>
  <li>The member’s age and sex determine which factor is to be applied. A member’s age is
calculated by subtracting his/her date of birth from the quotation date (which is
entered by the user, and which is defaulted to today’s date).</li>
  <li>This table lookup extracts the factor corresponding to member’s age next birthday
( if a member’s age = 30.5 then the factor for age 31 is returned ).</li>
  <li>The date argument can be set to TODAY. This will then use the most recent actuarial factor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<pre><code>$$00001(TODAY)
$$00001(20020101)
</code></pre>

<p>The first example refers to factor table 00001. The factor table used will be the one dated on or before today’s date.</p>

<p>The second example refers to factor table 00001. The factor table used will be the one dated on or before 01/01/2002.</p>

<h2><a name="03"></a>:table_code(@n,date)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the : symbol to refer to a particular term related factor table in your formula.
This looks up the factor table at nearest term. The second argument is used to find
the factor table that was effective at that date.</p>

<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>:table_code(@n,date) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>@ - is the symbol “@”. This is used to denote the start of the line number you wish to refer to in the function argument.</li>
  <li>n - is a valid formula line number which equates to the term you wish to look your term related factor at.</li>
  <li>date - is the effective date. If no table exists at this date then the previous table will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The member’s sex and relevant term determines which factor is to be applied.</li>
  <li>If you are unsure of the factor table required and you have already entered the :
part of the formula line, click the lookup icon for a list of factor tables.</li>
  <li>This table lookup interpolates between two factors if a member’s term does not exactly match a full year.</li>
  <li>The “@” symbol is optional but we would recommend that you use it as it makes the
formula more readable and immediately indicates to anyone looking at your formula
that the number in the function argument refers to a formula line number and not a
constant number.</li>
  <li>The date argument can be set to TODAY. This will then use the most recent term related factor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<pre><code>:00001(@1,TODAY)
:00001(@1,20001231)
</code></pre>

<p>The first example refers to term related factor table 00001 which is to be looked up
at a term equal to the result of line 1 in the formula. The factor table used will
be the one dated on or before today’s date.</p>

<p>The second example refers to term related factor table 00001 which is to be looked
up at a term equal to the result of line 1 in the formula. The factor table used will
be the one dated on or before 31/12/2000.</p>

<h2><a name="04"></a>::table_code(@n,date)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the :: symbol to refer to a particular term related factor table in your formula.
This looks up the factor table at the highest term to retirement. The second argument
is used to find the factor table that was effective at that date.</p>

<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>::table_code(@n,date) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>@ - is the symbol “@”. This is used to denote the start of the line number you wish to refer to in the function argument.</li>
  <li>n - is a valid formula line number which equates to the term you wish to look your term related factor at.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The member’s sex and relevant term determines which factor is to be applied.</li>
  <li>If you are unsure of the factor table required and you have already entered the ::
part of the formula line, click the lookup icon for a list of factor tables.</li>
  <li>This table lookup extracts the factor corresponding to the higher term to retirement
(if a member’s term to retirement = 30.5 then the factor for term 31 is returned ).</li>
  <li>The date argument can be set to TODAY. This will then use the most recent term related factor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<pre><code>:00001(@1,TODAY)
:00001(@1,20001231)
</code></pre>

<p>The first example refers to term related factor table 00001 which is to be looked up
at the higher term equal to the result of line 1 in the formula. The factor table
used will be the one dated on or before today’s date.</p>

<p>The second example refers to term related factor table 00001 which is to be looked
up at the higher term equal to the result of line 1 in the formula. The factor table
used will be the one dated on or before 31/12/2000.</p>

<h2><a name="05"></a>%table_code(@n,date)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the % symbol to refer to a particular term related factor table in your formula.
This looks up the term using the factor.</p>

  <li>date - is the effective date. If no table exists at this date then the previous table will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The member’s sex and relevant term determines which factor is to be applied.</li>
  <li>If you are unsure of the factor table required and you have already entered the %
part of the formula line, click the lookup icon for a list of factor tables.</li>
  <li>The date argument can be set to TODAY. This will then use the most recent term related factor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>

<pre><code>%CTALLOW(@1,TODAY)
</code></pre>

<p>This refers to term related factor table CTALLOW which is to be looked up
at a factor equal to the result of line 1 in the formula. The factor table
used will be the one dated on or before TODAY.</p>

<h2><a name="06"></a>factor(@x,term_act_flag,@y,date)</h2>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>

<p>Use the factor function to refer to a particular term related or actuarial factor table in your formula.
This looks up the factor table at nearest term or age nearest birthday. The fourth argument is used to find
the factor table that was effective at that date.</p>

<p><strong>SYNTAX</strong></p>

<pre><code>factor(@x,term_act_flag,@y,date) 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>@ - is the symbol “@”. This is used to denote the start of the line number you wish to refer to in the function argument.</li>

  <li>term_act_flag - takes the value of either T or A, which denotes whether the factor you wish to look up is term related or actuarial.</li>
  <li>@ - is the symbol “@”. This is used to denote the start of the line number you wish to refer to in the function argument.</li>
  <li>y - is a valid formula line number which equates to the term or age you wish to look your term related or actuarial factor at.</li>
  <li>date - is the effective date. If no table exists at this date then the previous table will be used.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The member’s sex and relevant term determines which factor is to be applied.</li>
  <li>This table lookup interpolates between two factors, if a member’s term/age does not exactly match a full year.</li>
  <li>The “@” symbol is optional but we would recommend that you use it as it makes the
formula more readable and immediately indicates to anyone looking at your formula
that the number in the function argument refers to a formula line number and not a
constant number.</li>
  <li>The date argument can be set to TODAY. This will then use the most recent term related/actuarial factor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EXAMPLES</strong></p>

<pre><code>factor(@1,T,@2,TODAY)
factor(@1,A,@2,20001231)
</code></pre>

<p>The first example refers to the term related factor table, that it referenced on line 1 in the formula, which is to be looked up at a term equal to the result of line 2 in the formula. The factor table used will be the one dated on or before today’s date.</p>

<p>The second example refers to the actuarial factor table, that is referenced on line 1 in the formula, which is to be looked up at an age equal to the result of line 1 in the formula. The factor table used will be the one dated on or before 31/12/2000.</p>
