<p>This program allows maintenance of the Member file. This is the core of the Pension
Master system and is where you will find all the data relating to a member of the

parts of the member’s data. To navigate between the screens in the Member File, use
the ‘Menu’ as described in <a href="#navigate">Navigating Between Screens</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the main screens of information that you may find in the Member File are as follows:</p>

these into Pension Master as appropriate.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PA</strong> - Pension Add</li>
  <li><strong>PI</strong> - Pension Ignore</li>

no increase has been performed on the current Pension Code) then the user will be
asked if the Initial Pension should be re-set to match the Current Pension. If the
Initial Pension is not re-set then the original Current Pension value will be shown
in this field.</p>

Spouses Pension.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the Pension Code starts with ‘PA’ then the value is <strong>added</strong> to the total value.</li>
  <li>If the Pension Code starts with ‘PI’ then the value is <strong>ignored</strong> (not included
in the total value).</li>
  <li>If the Pension Code starts with ‘PS’ then the value is <strong>subtracted</strong> from the
total value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also the value will only be included in the total calculation if the <a href="#ppa_dt_commence">Date
to Commence</a> is on or before today’s date, <strong>any future dates will be ignored</strong> regardless
of the Pension Code type.</p>

<p>The <strong>Full Totals</strong> are calculated in the same way as the <strong>Totals To Date</strong>, using the first two characters of the Pension Code, but are not limited by date.</p>

<h4><a name="care_pension_amount"></a>Screen 1) Career Average Revalued Earnings Current Amount</h4>

<p>This is used to record the component parts of the members care pension, e.g.
those parts of the members care pension that escalate or are calculated at different rates. Care
Pension Codes are used to indicate whether the component values are Added/Ignored
or Subtracted from the calculation of the members total Care Pension.</p>

<p>The Care Headings are initially entered via the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#CARE">Care Screens</a> menu
option in the Scheme File. The scheme needs to be set up as a Care scheme under basic scheme details.</p>

<p>It is also where you can record if a member has other care benefits in the scheme by inserting the member’s
number of the deferred record.</p>

<h4><a name="care_pension_increase_history"></a>Screen 2) Career Average Revalued Earnings -Increase History</h4>

<p>This records the full increase history of any changes made to a members Deferred
Pension benefit on the Deferred Pension History Screen. There is one screen per deferred
pension code shown on the Deferred Pension History screen with the facility to scroll
between the different deferred pension codes. The last 10 alterations made to a Deferred
Pension Code are displayed on the screen with options on the menu to allow any other

<ul>
  <li><strong>CA</strong> - Care Pension Add</li>
  <li><strong>CI</strong> - Care Pension Ignore</li>
  <li><strong>CS</strong> - Care Pension Subtract</li>
</ul>

<p>The Care Pensioner Codes are initially entered via the <a href="/pm90/pension/system_data/pem_codem/">Codes</a> menu
option on the System Data Menu. This allows
Codes to be entered with a brief description. For the code to be used against the
member, the code must be assigned to the members Scheme using the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#Code Allocation">Code
Allocation</a> menu option on the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/">Schemes</a> menu.</p>

<p>The totals at the bottom of the Care History Screen are calculated as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the Care Pension Code starts with ‘CA’ then the value is <strong>added</strong> to the total value.</li>
  <li>If the Care Pension Code starts with ‘CI’ then the value is <strong>ignored</strong> (not included in the total value).</li>
  <li>If the Care Pension Code starts with ‘CS’ then the value is <strong>subtracted</strong> from the total value.</li>
</ul>

<p>The date should be entered in the format ddmmyy or dd/mm/yyyy and the date must be later than the last date on the Career Average Revalued Earning
History screen for that code.</p>

  <p>Disability History Screen</p>
</div>

<p>The following buttons are active whilst you are editing the Disability History:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add Row</strong> - Open up a blank line for entry of new Disability details at the current cursor location.</li>
  <li><strong>Append</strong> - Adds a blank line for entry of new Disability details at the end.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete Row</strong> - Delete the current line of Disability History information. You will be prompted to confirm that this action is Ok.</li>
</ul>

<p>The input fields on the Disability History screen are as follows:</p>

<p><a name="pbpa_code"></a><strong>DISABILITY CODE</strong> - Enter a valid Disability Code or select
a code from the lookup list. The list has an indicator on the right-hand side to show
if the Pensioner Code has already been used by the current member.</p>

<p>The first two characters of the Disability Code indicate a different type of Pension
transaction:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>BA</strong> - Disability Add</li>
  <li><strong>BI</strong> - Disability Ignore</li>
  <li><strong>BS</strong> - Disability Subtract</li>
</ul>

<p>The Disability Codes are initially entered via the <a href="/pm90/pension/system_data/pem_codem/">Codes</a> menu
option on the System Data Menu. This allows
Codes to be entered with a brief description. For the code to be used against the
member, the code must be assigned to the members Scheme using the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#Code Allocation">Code
Allocation</a> menu option on the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/">Schemes</a> menu.</p>

<p><a name="pbpa_dt_commence"></a><strong>DATE TO COMMENCE</strong> - Enter the Date at which the
particular Pension component will Commence, in the format ddmmyy or dd/mm/yyyy.</p>

<p><a name="pbpa_init_ben"></a><strong>INITIAL PENSION</strong> - Enter the value of the Initial
Pension.</p>

<p>If the Initial Benefit has been amended and the Date of Last Increase is empty (i.e.
no increase has been performed on the current Pension Code) then the user will be
asked if the Current Pension should be re-set to match the Initial Pension. If the
Current Pension is not re-set then the original Initial Pension value will be shown
in this field.</p>

<p><a name="pbpa_dt_last_inc"></a><strong>DATE OF LAST INCREASE</strong> - Enter the Date of the Last
Benefit Increase, in the format ddmmyy or dd/mm/yyyy.</p>

<p><a name="pbpa_cur_benefit"></a><strong>CURRENT BENEFIT</strong> - Enter the amount of the Current
Benefit.</p>

<p>If the Current Benefit has been amended and the Date of Last Increase is empty (i.e.
no increase has been performed on the current Disability Code) then the user will be
asked if the Initial Benefit should be re-set to match the Current Benefit. If the
Initial Benefit is not re-set then the original Current Benefit value will be shown
in this field.</p>

<p>The totals at the bottom of the Disability History Screen are calculated as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the Code starts with ‘BA’ then the value is <strong>added</strong> to the total value.</li>
  <li>If the Code starts with ‘BI’ then the value is <strong>ignored</strong> (not included
in the total value).</li>
  <li>If the Code starts with ‘BS’ then the value is <strong>subtracted</strong> from the
total value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also the value will only be included in the total calculation if the <a href="#ppa_dt_commence">Date
to Commence</a> is on or before today’s date, <strong>any future dates will be ignored</strong> regardless
of the Disability Code type.</p>

<p>Once a line of Disability History Information has been entered or amended a pop-up window
is displayed showing the details that have just been entered.</p>

starts your word processor and transfers enough data to start and end the
letter i.e. it transfers the members address, inserts today’s date, sets
out the Dear xxx part of the letter and then does the Yours sincerely…
at the end of the letter. If the member’s address is flagged as suspect,
then you will be asked if you wish to use the suspect address. If the member’s
address it not available, the address of the company that the member belongs
to is used instead. Your name and job title will be automatically filled
in at the end of the letter.</p>
