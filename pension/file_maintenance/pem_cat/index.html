<p>The following screen is displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/pem_cat1.jpg" alt="Contribution Interest Details Screen" /></p>

  <p>Contribution Interest Details Screen</p>
</div>

<p>This screen allows you to record details of the rate of interest to be applied to
a contribution type in the case of a defined benefit type scheme where interest is
added to the total contributions on an regular basis.</p>

<p>The fields are described as follows:</p>

<p><a name="pcti_formula"></a><strong>FORMULA CODE</strong> - Enter a valid Formula Code or select
a code from the lookup list. If a Formula Code is entered with an Interest Rate on
the same line then an error message is displayed indicating that one of them must
be removed.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>The Formula must have previously been entered into the formula file using <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/calculation_setup/pem_form/#Introduction">Formulae</a>.
It should be checked to ensure that the formula correctly calculates an INTEREST RATE
ONLY. If the formula generates an inaccurate value, then the Exception Report will
ONLY detect any interest rates that are greater than 100% or less than -100%.</p>
</div>

<p>The calculation used is as follows:</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Interest Value = ( Contribution Amount + Contribution Interest ) * ( Formula Result / 100 )</p>
</div>

<p><a name="pcti_int"></a><strong>INTEREST</strong> - Enter a Percentage Rate. If a Percentage
Rate is entered with a Formula Code on the same line then an error message is displayed
indicating that one of them must be removed.</p>

<p>If interest is added to one or more contribution types, insert the interest rate against
the appropriate contribution type. These are numeric fields and the default values
are 0. These fields are used by the <a href="/pm90/pension/updates/peu_int/">Contribution Interest Run</a>.</p>

<p>The calculation used is as follows:</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Interest Value = ( Contribution Amount + Contribution Interest ) * ( Interest Rate / 100 )</p>
</div>

<p><a name="pcti_pro_rata"></a><strong>PRO RATA</strong> - Tick this box if a Pro Rata increase
should be calculated. This will determine the fraction of the Interest Rate increase
based on the members last Interest Run date and the current run date used in the <a href="/pm90/pension/updates/peu_int/">Contribution
Interest Run</a>.</p>

<p>If the partial year includes the 29th February, obviously of a leap year, then the
number of days in the calculation below will be 366. Otherwise the number of days
will be 365.</p>

<p>The calculation used for a Formula is as follows:</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Interest Value = ( Contribution Amount + Contribution Interest ) * ( ( Formula Result * ( Period in Days / 365 ) ) / 100 ) + Contribution Interest</p>
</div>

<p>The calculation used for a Fixed % Rate is as follows:</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Interest Value = ( Contribution Amount + Contribution Interest ) * ( ( Interest Rate * ( Period in Days / 365 ) ) / 100 ) + Contribution Interest</p>
</div>

<p>Click ‘OK’ to save the details, or click ‘Cancel’ to exit without saving the changes.</p>

<h3><a name="ContributionRate"></a>Contribution Rate Defaults</h3>

<p>Select the Contribution Rate Defaults screen using the menu.</p>

<p>The following screen is displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/pem_cat13.jpg" alt="Contribution Rate Defaults Screen" /></p>

  <p>Contribution Rate Defaults Screen</p>
</div>

<p>This screen allows you to enter the specific contribution rate percentages for each
applicable contribution type for members of this category. If you are doing a Contribution
Request Run and the member in question does not have any entries on their <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Contribution Rate Percentages">Contribution
Rate Percentages</a> screen, the equivalent values at Category level are used in the
calculations.</p>

<p>These are then used by the <a href="/pm90/pension/investments/contribution_entry/peu_cont/">Contribution Request Run</a>
to generate batches of contribution requests for the scheme.</p>

<p>Click ‘Update’.</p>

<p>Enter the fields as follows:</p>

<p><a name="pcc_frequency"></a><strong>CONTRIBUTION FREQUENCY</strong> - Enter the frequency of
your contributions for members of this category. The valid options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1</strong> - Annual</li>
  <li><strong>2</strong> - Half yearly</li>
  <li><strong>12</strong> - Monthly</li>
  <li><strong>4</strong> - Quarterly</li>
  <li><strong>52</strong> - Weekly</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pcc_cont"></a><strong>CONT TYPE</strong> - Enter the contribution type code for this line.</p>

<p><a name="pcc_type"></a><strong>TYPE</strong> - Enter the code for the type of calculation of
contributions you require for this contribution type. The valid options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>PERCENT</strong> - percentage of salary</li>
  <li><strong>FLATRATE</strong> - flat rate</li>
  <li><strong>EEPR</strong> - employee’s protected rights</li>
  <li><strong>ERPR</strong> - employer’s protected rights</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that types EEPR and ERPR are only calculated for members who are on NI Table
F i.e. an entry of ‘F’ is in the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#pm_nitab">NI Table</a> field
on the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Member Indicator Details">Member Indicators screen</a>
in the members record.</p>

<p><a name="pcc_rate"></a><strong>ANNL RATE</strong> - If PERCENT type code is used, enter the
percentage rate to use.</p>

<p><a name="pcc_salary"></a><strong>SALARY TO USE</strong> - If PERCENT type code is used, enter
the salary to use in the calculation.</p>

<p><a name="pcc_formula"></a><strong>FORMULA</strong> - Enter a formula code to use to calculate
the contributions for this contribution type. The formula must be a valid formula
for this scheme. If a valid formula code is entered, all the other parameters for
the calculation of contributions for this contribution type are ignored.</p>

<p>Using a formula to calculate contributions is especially useful if contributions are
calculated in a more complicated way than the basic options here permit e.g. you might
have an age related percentage of salary contribution rate. In this case, you could
use <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/calculation_setup/pem_form/">Formulae</a> in conjunction with an age related
<a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/calculation_setup/pem_fac">Factors</a> to calculate the contributions.</p>

<p>Note that the numeric result of your formula is the value that is saved as the members
contribution amount for that contribution type.</p>

<p>Click ‘OK’ to save the details, or click ‘Cancel’ to exit without saving the changes.</p>

<h3><a name="Update A Quotation Type"></a>Update A Quotation Type</h3>

<p>Select the relevant Quotation Type screen using the menu, then click ‘Update’.</p>

<p>This screen allows you to set up groups of calculations you wish to have for members
of this category. This allows you to completely customise the way the Quotation Screens
look in <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Running Benefit Quotations/Calculations">Members</a>.</p>

<p>As part of the Pension Master quotations engine, the user can either write the results of
finalised quotations back to the member record, or they can just simply finalise the results without writing back to a screen. Writing the results back to a screen can be done by two methods:</p>

<ol>
  <li>By setting up a <em>User Defined Screen</em> to hold the details you wish to write back
from your quotations. e.g. you might set up a User Defined Screen called ‘REFUND’
to hold details of the results of refund of contributions calculations that have been
finalised.</li>
  <li>By directly sending the finalised quotations through to a screen held in Member File.
The screens set up for this facility are:</li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <table class="table table-condensed">
      <thead>
        <tr>

<p>In this Quotation Type screen, you set up each field that you wish to hold data for.
The fields <strong>must</strong> be set up as either decimal, integer, character or date, so
they can correctly display your calculation results. You then use the WRITE, NUM and
SUB CODE fields on the second screen of Categories to indicate how these finalised
results are to be written back to the member record.</p>

<p>Finalising the results without writing back to a screen can be done by choosing the ‘Finalise’ option in the ‘Write Results To’ field.</p>

<p>The following screen is displayed:</p>
