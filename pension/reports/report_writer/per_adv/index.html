<h2><a name="1"></a><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This program produces a report on any database table columns selected by the user.
Whilst the user enters details into the screens, an SQL statement is being produced
which will then be used in running the report. You can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the columns you wish to appear on the report.</li>
  <li>Define a report title which will appear at the top of each page of your report.</li>
  <li>Select how to group the data on the report e.g. by scheme.</li>
  <li>Select which numeric data fields you wish to total up and how you wish the total to
be applied to the data.</li>
  <li>Select whether you wish the report to be output in report format or comma-delimited
data format (.CSV format) and exported to Microsoft Excel. The .CSV format is suitable
for importing into other applications like spreadsheets.</li>
  <li>Define the headings you wish to appear for each column of data output to your report.</li>
  <li>Define the layout of the report.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following options and screen appear when this program is selected. Certain menu
options may only be visible when you have selected a report using the ‘Query’ menu
option.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add</li>
  <li>Query</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

  <p>Field Selection Screen</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="Add A New Report"></a>Add A New Report</h2>

<p>Click ‘Add’.</p>

<p>The following window will be displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/per_memw.jpg" alt="Add Report Options" /></p>

  <p>Add Report Options</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Copy an existing report?</strong> - Checking this box will allow you to copy an existing
Report rather than input the complete report from scratch. You will then be able to
edit the report as required and save it using a different name.</p>

<p>Enter the report code of the report you wish to copy. You can also click on the lookup icon
to see a list reports. Once this has been done, the window closes and you will be returned
to the report Code field for your new report.</p>

<p><strong>Export to Microsoft Excel?</strong> - Checking this box will create a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet on your PC that will contain the selected data.</p>

<p>The report will produce a data export file in .CSV (comma separated value) file format
and also export the data directly into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet on your PC.</p>

<p>Details of where the data file can be found is set out in the <a href="#Where To Find The Resulting Exported Data File">Where
To Find The Resulting Exported Data File</a> section later in this document.</p>

<p><strong>Print column headings on your exported data?</strong> - If you have chosen to export
your report data, you will then be able to check this box if you wish to print column
headers on the exported data. If you are doing a data extract for electronic transmission
onto another software system, you would normally not export column headings and just
send a block of data which can then be easily imported into other software systems.
If, however you wish to export the data to an Excel spreadsheet that can be easily
understood by another user we would recommend that you export column headings. This
box is defaulted to a tick.</p>

<p>If you choose not to output the report in export format, the report will be produced
in normal report format and be available to view/print in the same way as all other
reports in Pension Master.</p>

<p><a name="advance"></a>You are then requested to enter the report header details you
are going to save the report under.</p>

<p><a name="psc_scheme"></a><strong>SCHEME CODE</strong> - Enter the scheme code you wish to save
the report under. You can click on the lookup icon for a list of valid scheme
codes. This field is mandatory.</p>

<p><a name="gna_code"></a><strong>REPORT CODE</strong> - Enter the report code you wish to save
the report under. If another report already exists for the same combination of scheme
code and report code, the user is informed of this and will be prompted to enter a
different report code. This field is mandatory.</p>

<p><a name="gna_desc"></a><strong>REPORT DESCRIPTION</strong> - Enter the report description you
wish to save the report under. This field is mandatory.</p>

<p>You are then requested to enter at least one line of data in the history at the bottom
of the screen.</p>

<p><a name="gnaf_field_desc"></a><strong>FIELD DESCRIPTION</strong> - This denotes either a field
description you wish to appear on the report or the result of a particular formula
output to the report. Which one is dependant on how you enter the field:</p>

<h2><a name="To Output A Particular Field"></a>To Output A Particular Field</h2>

<p>If you wish to enter a field description, for example Member Number off the Basic
Member Details table, then you can do so via a number of ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter the field as pm_member, which will then automatically be altered to the wordy
description of Member Number.</li>
  <li>Enter the wordy description directly into the field. In the case of Member Number
and some other popular columns, a pop-up window may be displayed to the screen with
a list of database tables, all of which contain the same wordy description for one
of their columns. You are then prompted to choose which database table the Member
Number is referring to.</li>
  <li>You can click on the lookup icon to see a list of all the available fields. This
will return the wordy description of the field chosen, back to the Field Description
field.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="To Output The Results Of A Particular Formula"></a>To Output The Results Of A Particular Formula</h2>

<p>To reference calculations in your report, enter the appropriate formula code in the format:</p>

<pre><code>#calc(formula_code,width)
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li>where formula_code is a valid formula code for the scheme implied by the current selection
criteria. If an invalid formula code is entered, you will be warned of this and invited
to re-enter a valid formula code.</li>
  <li>where width is a number that is between 10 and 100. The minimum width of the result
of a formula is 10, this is the width of the standard date format (dd/mm/yyyy). The
maximum width, 100, is the longest character string that can be produced by a formula.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unsure of a particular formula code, type at least the # of the #calc and
then click on the lookup icon to see a list of the available formula codes
for the scheme code entered in the report header. Upon selecting a formula code, the
report field will automatically be filled in with the correct wordy description ‘#formula_code
description’ syntax e.g. if #calc(092,10) is selected then the description ‘#Total
RGMP’ is displayed to the field. The # will determine that a formula has been selected.
The width of the formula result is defaulted to 10.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>The ‘#calc’ facility can only be used when the Member Number has also been selected
from the Basic Member Details table (pe_mem.pm_member). If the Member Number has not
been selected and you try to enter a ‘#calc’ formula line, the user will be informed
of this and will not be allowed to continue to enter the #calc line, until Member
Number has been selected.</p>
</div>

<p>The field must be set up on the Report Units file (see <a href="/pm90/pension/reports/report_writer/pem_rep/">Member
Report Units</a>) or can be a direct link to a valid formula for the chosen scheme
code. In the case of a field, if it does not exist on the <a href="/pm90/pension/reports/report_writer/pem_rep/">report
units file</a> an error message
will be displayed and the field-name must be re-entered. Click on the lookup icon
to see a list of the available fields for the report. In the case of a formula,
you can click on the ‘Formula’ button whilst in the field and the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/calculation_setup/pem_form/">Formula</a> program
will be brought up to the screen showing the details of the formula selected.</p>

<p>When a field is entered a message will be displayed to the bottom of the screen:</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>Report Width : xx</p>
</div>

<p><a name="gnaf_include"></a><strong>INCLUDE ON REPORT</strong> - Tick the box if you wish to
include the field description entered on the report. You cannot entered a tick in
this field is the corresponding field description is blank.</p>

<p><a name="gnaf_total"></a><strong>PRINT TOTAL</strong> - Tick the box if you wish to print a
total of the field description at the end of the report. You can only tick this field
if the field description is entered, the include on report field is ticked and the
field description is of a numeric/decimal type.</p>

<p><a name="gnaf_sort"></a><strong>SORT ORDER</strong> - Enter a numeric value between 1 and 6
in this field. You can only enter a value in this field if the field description is
entered. A maximum of 6 columns can be used to sort data by, per report.</p>

<p><a name="gnaf_asc_desc"></a><strong>ASC/DESC</strong> - Valid values for this field are ‘A’
- Ascending, and ‘D’ - Descending. This field can only be entered if the field description
is entered, and the Sort Order field is entered. This field defaults to ‘A’ - Ascending,
when a value has been entered in the Sort Order field.</p>

<p>The details entered into this screen will generate the first part of the SQL statement
ie. the ‘SELECT’ section.</p>

<p>When all details have been entered on this first screen click on ‘OK’ to proceed to
the following screen.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>If you are producing the report in Report and not Export format, the width of the
report should not go over 180 characters. If the report width goes over 180 characters,
an error message will be displayed and you should then remove any fields that you
do not require from your report so that the total report width is less than 180 characters.</p>
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>If you are producing the report in Export format, then the width of a field should
not go over 255 characters. This is because Microsoft Excel cannot cope with fields
wider than this amount. If the field width goes over 255 characters, then the field’s
data will be cut down to 255 characters before it gets sent to Microsoft Excel.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="Between Screens Selection"></a>Between Screens Selection</h2>

<p>Before the second screen is displayed to the screen, the program will work out the
start of the SQL statement to be used in the report. The database tables to be used
in the statement will be determined and any auto-generated lines to link tables with
one another will be created to then be displayed to screen 2.</p>

<p>If at least one formula line has been entered in screen 1, then a line defaulting
the calculation date to TODAY, will also be auto-generated for screen 2.</p>

<h2><a name="2"></a><a name="Criteria Selection"></a>Criteria Selection</h2>

<p>Press <kbd>2</kbd>, or select the ‘Criteria Selection’ from the ‘Menu’ menu option with the
arrow keys and press <kbd>Return</kbd>. If you are in the process of generating a new
report, then this screen automatically gets displayed after you have entered details
in screen 1.</p>

<p>The second screen is displayed as follows:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/per_adv2.jpg" alt="Criteria Selection Screen" /></p>

  <p>Criteria Selection Screen</p>
</div>

<p><a name="p_and_or"></a><strong>AND/OR CLAUSE</strong> - Enter either ‘AND’ or ‘OR’ into this
field. The first line of the history will not allow the user to enter into the field
due to the first line going into the SELECT statement from this screen will always
use the ‘WHERE’ clause. The default value for this field is ‘AND’.</p>

<p><a name="p_bracket_1"></a><strong>BRACKET 1</strong> - This field can take the value of either blank or ‘(‘.  If a ‘(‘ is entered then ensure that a corresponding ‘)’ bracket is entered in Bracket 3 or 4 field on one of the lines to follow.</p>

<p><a name="p_bracket_2"></a><strong>BRACKET 2</strong> - This field can take the value of either blank or ‘(‘.  If a ‘(‘ is entered then ensure that a corresponding ‘)’ bracket is entered in Bracket 3 or 4 field on one of the lines to follow.</p>

<p><a name="gnas_field_desc1"></a><strong>FIELD 1</strong> - This denotes either a field description or an actual value which you wish
to compare the Field 2 value against.</p>

<p>If a field description is to be entered then it must be from a database table already
used in the screen 1 selection. If you are unsure of which tables have been selected,
then you can click on the lookup icon for a list of the database tables
already used. If you know which tables are in use, then you can enter the field description
using the same method used in the <a href="#Field Description">Field Description</a> field
on screen 1.</p>

<p>If an actual value is to be entered then dependant on the value’s type ie. character,
date, numeric or decimal, it may need to be in single, double or no quotations:</p>

<p>Click ‘Update’.</p>

<p>Select the screen you wish to update by selecting it from the ‘Menu’ menu option with
the arrow keys and pressing <kbd>Return</kbd>, or by using the hot-keys 1 thru to 5 respectively.</p>

<h2><a name="Re-Run An Existing Report"></a>Re-Run An Existing Report</h2>

<p>Click ‘Run’.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>You must have selected a report to run using the ‘Query’ menu option prior to selecting
the ‘Run’ menu option. If you have not done this an error message will be displayed
and you will be returned to the main menus.</p>
</div>

<p>You are now prompted as to whether you wish the output of the report to be in export
file format.</p>

<p>When the report is being run, it will produce a data export file in .CSV (comma separated
value) file format and also export the data directly into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
on your PC.</p>

<p>Details of where these data files can be found is set out in the <a href="#Where To Find The Resulting Exported Data File">Where
To Find The Resulting Exported Data File</a> section later in this document.</p>

<p>If you have chosen to export your reported data, then you can the tick the Print Column
Headers box if you wish to print column headers on the exported data. If you are doing
a data extract for electronic transmission onto another software system, you would
normally not export column headings and just send a block of data which can then be
easily imported into other software systems. If, however, you wish to export the data
to an Excel spreadsheet that can be easily understood by another user, then we would
recommend that you export column headings.</p>

<p>If you choose not to output the report in export format, the report will be produced
in the normal report format and be available to view/print in the same way as all
other reports in Pension Master.</p>

<p>To process the report, click on ‘OK’. A message will be displayed:</p>

<div class="well">

  <p>Processing report … Please Wait</p>

</div>

<p>If you have selected the eXport option from the menu, Microsoft Excel will be started
automatically and you data placed into a fresh spreadsheet within Excel. The filename
for this spreadsheet is c:\penmast.xls. Once you have finished with this spreadsheet,
exit Microsoft Excel to return control to the Advanced Report Generator program.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>Pension Master will automatically overwrite the file c:\penmast.xls with the new
data export if you run the Advanced Report Generator with the eXport menu option.
Any data that is currently in that file will thus be overwritten.
If you wish to keep this data, we suggest you manually copy the file c:\penmast.xls
to another directory prior to running your data export.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="Delete An Advanced Report"></a>Delete An Advanced Report</h2>

<p>Click ‘Delete’.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>You must have selected a report to delete using the ‘Query’ menu option prior to
selecting the ‘Delete’ menu option. If you have not done this then an error message
will be displayed and you will be returned to the main menu.</p>
</div>

<p>The option allows you to delete an existing Advanced Report from Pension Master.</p>
