<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Pension Increase Run calculates new pension values based upon either a percentage
rate or the result of a formula.</p>

<p>The program is split into 4 main sections described as follows:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <table class="table table-condensed">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Provisional</strong></td>
          <td>This allows an increase run to be performed but <strong>does not update</strong> the Pension/Deferred Pension History.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Actual</strong></td>
          <td>This allows an increase run to be performed and <strong>does update</strong> the Pension/Deferred Pension History.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Undo</strong></td>
          <td>This allows an increase run to be removed from the Pension/Deferred Pension Increase History screen and reverts the values on the History screen back to before the Actual Increase run was performed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Delete</strong></td>
          <td>This allows a previously saved Increase Parameter to be removed.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The members that are increased can be selected using standard <a href="/pm90/pension/appendices/app_b/#Simple Selection Criteria">Simple
Selection Criteria</a> (i.e. Scheme, Company, Category, Status, Special Code and Member).
A list of Pension Codes currently allocated to the scheme is displayed allowing either
all the codes to be updated with a global Formula/Fixed Rate or to be increased individually.</p>

<p>The information used to select the members and the specific increase information used
against each Pension Code can be saved as an individual set of parameters (known as
a Pension Increase Parameter Set). These parameters are specific to each scheme and
each pension type, for either Deferred Pension or Pension increases. This allows them
to be saved, using a descriptive name, for future use.</p>

<p>Select the Pension Increase Run option from the Updates menu.</p>

<p>The following options and screen is displayed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run</li>
  <li>Undo</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

<div class="screen">

  <p>Pension Increase Run Screen</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="Provisional Increase"></a><a name="prov"></a>Provisional Increase</h2>

<p>Click ‘Run’, and then select the ‘Provisional’ option from the pop-up window.</p>

<p>This option allows an increase run to be performed but <strong>does not update</strong> the
Pension/Deferred Pension History.</p>

<p>A small Run Parameters window is displayed allowing basic details of the Pension Increase
Run to be entered:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_pirp2.jpg" alt="Run Parameters Window" /></p>

  <p>Run Parameters Window</p>
</div>

<p>This window allows additional run parameters to be entered as follows:</p>

<p><a name="pp_scheme"></a><strong>SCHEME</strong> - Enter the Scheme Code or select a code from
the lookup list. The code that is entered will be used to select only members for
this scheme. It will also allow any increase parameters that are saved to be re-used
for increases to this scheme.</p>

<p><a name="pp_type"></a><strong>PENSIONER/DEFERRED PENSIONER</strong> - Click on a button to select
either Pensioners or Deferred Pensioners to be increased. If no option is selected
then Pensioner will be selected by default.</p>

<p><a name="incr_pp_date"></a><strong>INCREASE DATE</strong> - Enter the date from which your pension
increases are applicable in the format ddmmyy or dd/mm/yyyy. A value must be entered
in this field and the date must be a valid date.</p>

<p>This date is used to update the Date of Last Increase on the History screen (see <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Pension History Screen">Pension
History</a> and <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Deferred Pension History Screen">Deferred Pension
History</a>) and also to generate a new line on the Increase History screen (see <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Pension Increase History Screen">Pension
Increase History</a> and <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Deferred Pension Increase History Screen">Deferred
Pension Increase History</a>).</p>

<p><a name="incr_pp_saved"></a><strong>USE A SAVED INCREASE PARAMETER?</strong> - Check the tick
box if you wish to select a previously saved Increase Parameter.</p>

<p>If you are using a saved Increase Parameter then a lookup list will be displayed showing
all the saved parameters for that particular scheme and pension type (either Pensioner/Deferred
Pensioner).</p>

<p>When the Run Parameters have been entered, click ‘OK’ to proceed or click ‘Cancel’
to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>The following selection criteria screen will be displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_pisel2.jpg" alt="Provisional Pension Increase Run Screen" /></p>

  <p>Provisional Pension Increase Run Screen</p>
</div>

<p>If an Existing Increase has been selected from the Run Parameter window then the name
of the parameter file selected will appear at the top of the screen. The screen will
also be pre-filled with any information that was used as selection criteria when the
original increase as saved.</p>

<p><a name="pm_company"></a><a name="pm_category"></a><a name="pm_status"></a><a name="psft_code"></a><a name="pm_member"></a><strong>SELECTION
CRITERIA</strong> - Select the group of members you require to run pension increases for
using the Company, Category, Status, Special Code and Member fields (see <a href="/pm90/pension/appendices/app_b/">Selection Criteria</a>).
When the selection criteria have been entered click on ‘OK’ to proceed or click on
‘Cancel’ to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>A confirmation message will be displayed if no selection criteria has been entered.
This simply states that all members have been selected and that the processing could
possibly take some time.</p>

<p>The following screen is displayed if Pensioners have been selected using the Run Parameter
window:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_picod1.jpg" alt="Provisional Pension Increase Run Screen" /></p>

  <p>Provisional Pension Increase Run Screen</p>
</div>

<p>The following screen is displayed if Deferred Pensioners have been selected using
the Run Parameter window:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_picod2.jpg" alt="Provisional Pension Increase Run Screen" /></p>

  <p>Provisional Pension Increase Run Screen</p>
</div>

<p>When the increase information has been entered click on ‘OK’ to proceed or click on
‘Cancel’ to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>NOTE: If an Existing Increase has been selected: A check is made at this point
to ensure that there is no discrepancy between the Pension Codes saved and Pension
Codes allocated to the scheme. A message will be displayed showing any Pension Codes
that have been allocated to, or removed from, the scheme since the increase was saved.
Any new Pension Codes will be displayed with no formula or fixed rate against it.</p>

<p>This screen displays all the Pension Codes, and descriptions, of the members that
have been selected using the selection criteria. The screen allows global or individual
Pension Codes to be increased by either the result of a Formula Code or by a Fixed
% Rate. For example to increase Pensioners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you want to increase all the Pension Codes, for the members, by the same percentage
then enter a Fixed % Rate in the global section on the member line. The Global Pro
Rata field can be ticked as required and a Global Reason for Increase Code must be
entered. When the global details have been entered the information will be copied
down the screen against each of the Pension Codes.</li>
  <li>If you want to increase a single Pension Code, for spouses, using the result of a
formula then click in the field required, and enter a valid Formula Code against the
Pension Code on the spouses line. Also a valid Reason for Increase Code must be entered.</li>
</ul>

<p>The fields on this screen vary depending on whether you have selected Pensioner or
Deferred Pensioner in the Run Parameter window:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">

    <table class="table table-condensed">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>For Pensioners</td>
          <td>Members and Spouses pension values can be increased.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>For Deferred Pensioners</td>
          <td>Members and Spouses (Before and After the Normal Pension Date) pension values can be increased.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The fields are described as follows:</p>

<p><a name="pm_formula"></a><a name="ps_formula"></a><a name="pb_formula"></a><a name="pa_formula"></a><strong>FORMULA
CODE</strong> - Enter a valid Formula Code or select a code from the lookup list. If a
Formula Code is entered with a Fixed % Rate on the same line then an error message
is displayed indicating that one of them must be removed. Any Formula Code that is
entered on the global line will be automatically entered into the Formula Code fields
against each of the Pension Codes.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>The Formula must have previously been entered into the formula file using <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/calculation_setup/pem_form/#Introduction">Formulae</a>.
It should be checked to ensure that the formula correctly calculates an INCREASE VALUE
ONLY. If the formula generates an inaccurate value, then the Exception Report will
ONLY detect any new pension value that is more or less than 100% different from the
original value.</p>
</div>

<p>The calculation used is as follows (All the calculations should be rounded to 8 decimal
places unless otherwise stated):</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Pension Value = (Current Pension + Formula Result) / Pay Frequency (Rounded to 2 decimal places)</p>

  <p>New Pension Value = Pay Frequency * New Pension Value</p>
</div>

<p><a name="pm_rate"></a><strong>FIXED % RATE</strong> - Enter a Fixed Percentage Rate. If a Fixed
Percentage Rate is entered with a Formula Code on the same line then an error message
is displayed indicating that one of them must be removed. Any rate that is entered
on the global line will be automatically entered into the Fixed Percentage Rate fields
against each of the Pension Codes.</p>

<p>The calculation used is as follows (All the calculations should be rounded to 8 decimal
places unless otherwise stated):</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Pension Value = (Current Pension / Pay Frequency) * (Fixed % Rate / 100 + 1) (Rounded to 2 decimal places)</p>

  <p>New Pension Value = Pay Frequency * New Pension Value</p>
</div>

<p><a name="pm_pro_rata"></a><a name="ps_pro_rata"></a><a name="pb_pro_rata"></a><a name="pa_pro_rata"></a><strong>PRO
RATA</strong> - Tick this box if a Pro Rata increase should be calculated. This will determine
the fraction of the Formula/Fixed % Rate increase based on the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the member is a New Pensioner (a pensioner that has had no previous increases)
then the partial year is determined from the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#ppa_dt_commence">Date
to Commence</a> to the Increase Date.</li>
  <li>If the member is a New Widower (a widower that has had no previous increases) then
the partial year is determined from the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#pps_orig_mem_st_dt">Original
Members Start Date</a> to the Increase Date.</li>
  <li>If the member is a New Deferred Pensioner (a deferred pensioner that has had no previous
increases) then the partial year is determined from the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#pm_dtlft">Date
Left</a> to the Increase Date.</li>
  <li>If the member is a Pensioner/Widower/Deferred Pensioner who has had a previous increase
for a pension element then the partial year is determined from the Date of Last Increase
to the Increase Date.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: When using a Pro Rata increase, the increase will be calculated for both new
and existing Pensioners/Deferred Pensioners using the rules above.</p>

<p>If the partial year includes the 29th February, obviously of a leap year, then the
number of days in the calculation below will be 366. Otherwise the number of days
will be 365.</p>

<p>The calculation used for a Fixed % Rate is as follows (All the calculations should
be rounded to 8 decimal places unless otherwise stated):</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Pension Value = (Current Pension / Pay Frequency) * ((Fixed % Rate * (Period in Days / 365)) / 100 + 1) (Rounded to 2 decimal places)</p>

  <p>New Pension Value = Pay Frequency * New Pension Value</p>
</div>

<p>The calculation used for a Formula is as follows:</p>

<div class="well">
  <p>New Pension Value = (Current Pension + ((Formula Result / 365) * Period in Days)) / Pay Frequency (Rounded to 2 decimal places)</p>

  <p>New Pension Value = Pay Frequency * New Pension Value</p>
</div>

<p><a name="pm_rounding"></a><a name="ps_rounding"></a><a name="pb_rounding"></a><a name="pa_rounding"></a><strong>ROUNDING</strong> - Enter a figure here if you want Rounding to be applied to the final figure. 
An entry of 0.05 will round the final figure to the nearest 5c.</p>

<p><a name="p_reason_code"></a><strong>REASON FOR INCREASE CODE</strong> - Enter a valid Reason
for Increase Code or select a code from the lookup list. A Reason Code must be entered
if a Formula Code or Fixed % Rate is entered on the line.</p>

<p>This code is used to describe the type of increase that has been performed. It is
shown on the Increase History screen (see <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Pension Increase History Screen">Pension
Increase History</a> and <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Deferred Pension Increase History Screen">Deferred
Pension Increase History</a>) on the new line generated by the increase run.</p>

<p>When the increase information has been entered, click ‘OK’ to proceed or click ‘Cancel’
to return to the main menu. Only codes that have a Formula or a Fixed % Rate are processed.</p>

<p><a name="save"></a>If you selected a New Increase in the Run Parameters window or
if you selected an Existing Increase (and have changed some of the parameters) then
you will be asked if you wish to save this set of parameters. A small window will
appear prompting you to enter a suitable name. If the name you have entered already
exists then you will be asked to confirm that you want to overwrite these details.</p>

<p>Two reports are generated after the calculation of the pension increases:</p>

<p><strong>EXCEPTION REPORT</strong> - If any exceptions have been found then the number of exceptions
will be displayed and you will be asked if you wish to view or print the report.</p>

<p>This report details any problems that have been found during the calculation of 
pension increases. Usually a problem may occur because of existing pension details.
Where applicable the Pension Code and it’s Description are printed along with a comment
describing the problem that has been found. Possible exception messages are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No Pensioner Records Found.</li>
  <li>Reason for Increase Code (RPENINC) is not allocated to this Scheme.</li>
  <li>Date to Commence (07/07/1999) is after the Increase Date.</li>
  <li>Date of Cessation (01/01/1999) is before the Increase Date.</li>
  <li>Date of Last Inc. (02/02/1999) is on or after the Increase Date.</li>
  <li>Formula Code (A550) not found in Scheme.</li>
  <li>Pension increase (from 10123.45 to 20123.45) is greater than 100%.</li>
  <li>Pension increase (from 20123.45 to 10123.45) is less than -100%.</li>
  <li>The formula has not returned a numeric value.</li>
</ul>

<p>The options for printing are described in the document <a href="/pm90/pension/general/gn_printm/">Printing
From Pension Master</a>.</p>

<p><strong>INCREASE REPORT</strong> - If any pension increases have been successfully calculated
then the number of increases will be displayed and you will be asked if you wish to
view or print the report.</p>

<p>The report shows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Member details.</li>
  <li>The Pension Code that has been increased and it’s description.</li>
  <li>Details of the calculation used for the Pension Code.</li>
  <li>The pension values both before and after the increase.</li>
</ul>

<p>The options for printing are described in the document <a href="/pm90/pension/general/gn_printm/">Printing
From Pension Master</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="Actual Increase"></a>Actual Increase</h2>

<p>Click ‘Run’, and then select the ‘Actual’ option from the pop-up window.</p>

<p>This option allows an increase run to be performed and <strong>does update</strong> the Pension/Deferred
Pension History.</p>

<p>The Actual Increase run is performed in the same way as the Provisional Increase run
except that the members details are updated.</p>

<p>When you have checked that the selected members will be increased by the amount required,
you will be asked to confirm that you wish to update the number of increases generated.
If you have selected ‘Yes’ you will then be asked to re-confirm that you wish to update
these increases. If you select ‘No’ at any time you will be returned to the menu with
no further action taking place.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>When the Actual Increase is performed the program may encounter Pensioner or Deferred
Pensioner records that are locked by other users on the system. These locked records
will appear on the Exception Report with a comment of ‘Record locked’. It is
therefore important that this report is checked to ensure that ALL the selected members
values have been increased by the required amount.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="Undo Increase"></a>Undo Increase</h2>

<p>Click ‘Undo’.</p>

<p>This allows an increase run to be removed from the Pension/Deferred Pension Increase
History screen and reverts the values on the History screen back to before the Actual
Increase run was performed.</p>

<p>A small Run Parameters window is displayed allowing basic details of the Pension Increase
Undo to be entered:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_pirp4.jpg" alt="Run Parameters Window" /></p>

  <p>Run Parameters Window</p>
</div>

<p>This window allows additional undo parameters to be entered as follows:</p>

<p><a name="pp_scheme"></a><strong>SCHEME</strong> - Enter the Scheme Code or select a code from
the lookup list. The code that is entered will be used to select only members for
this scheme.</p>

<p><a name="pp_type"></a><strong>PENSIONER/DEFERRED PENSIONER</strong> - Click on a button to select
either Pensioners or Deferred Pensioners to be undone. If no option is selected then
Pensioner will be selected by default.</p>

<p><a name="undo_pp_date"></a><strong>UNDO INCREASE DATE</strong> - Enter the date that you want
to undo in the format ddmmyy or dd/mm/yyyy. A value must be entered in this field
and the date must be a valid date.</p>

<p>This date is used to change the Date of Last Increase on the History screen (see <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Pension History Screen">Pension
History</a> and <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Deferred Pension History Screen">Deferred Pension
History</a>) to the previous increase date, if any. Also it will delete the corresponding
lines on the Increase History screen (see <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Pension Increase History Screen">Pension
Increase History</a> and <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Deferred Pension Increase History Screen">Deferred
Pension Increase History</a>).</p>

<p><a name="undo_pp_saved"></a><strong>UNDO A SAVED INCREASE?</strong> - Check the tick box if
you wish to select a previously saved Increase Parameter to undo.</p>

<p>When the Run Parameters have been entered, click ‘OK’ to proceed or click ‘Cancel’
to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>If New Undo has been selected then the following selection criteria screen will be
displayed:</p>

<p>If Undo Existing Increase has been selected then a lookup list will be displayed showing
all the saved parameters for that particular scheme and pension type (either Pensioner/Deferred
Pensioner). Upon selecting a parameter from the list the following selection criteria
screen will be displayed showing the saved information:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_pisel3.jpg" alt="Pension Increase Undo Screen" /></p>

  <p>Pension Increase Undo Screen</p>
</div>

<p>When the selection criteria has been entered, click ‘OK’ to proceed or click ‘Cancel’
to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>The following screen shows all the codes that have been found using the above criteria.
This criteria also includes the Scheme, Pension type and the Date of Increase that
was entered using the Run Parameter Window.</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_piundo.jpg" alt="Pension Increase Undo Screen" /></p>

  <p>Pension Increase Undo Screen</p>
</div>

<p><a name="p_undo"></a><strong>UNDO</strong> - Tick the box to select the Pension Code to undo.
If the undo box on the global line is ticked then all the Pension Codes will be undone.</p>

<p>NOTE: Only the last increase can be removed from Pension/Deferred Pension Increase
History. If a date is entered that is not the last increase then a ‘No Members have
been selected with this criteria.’ error message will be displayed. This is because
checks will be made against the Pension/Deferred Pension History screen to find information
that matches the criteria entered.</p>

<p>After the processing has been completed you will be asked if you wish to view the
increases that will be undone. The Undo Report contains the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Member details.</li>
