<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This program allows entry and maintenance of batches of either salary, NI history
or contribution history data for a group of members. This is typically used to input
the annual renewal data for a defined benefit type scheme.</p>

<p>The data is held at the batch level until you are satisfied that it is correct, at
which time you can opt to post the data off to the individual member records.</p>

<p>This means that the data is held separate from the main member data until such time
as you are satisfied it is correct and choose to update the main member data with
the details.</p>

<p>You can use this to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter batches of salary details</li>
  <li>Enter batches of NI contracted-out earnings details (UK Only)</li>
  <li>Enter batches of contribution details.</li>
  <li>Post batched data to the relevant history file on each members record.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="1"></a>The following options and screen appear when this program is selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add</li>
  <li>Query</li>
  <li>Update</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
  <li>Report</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

available batch types:</p>

<ul>

<p>You will be asked if you wish to continue with the Batch Posting. If you have selected
the Yes option, the batch will be posted and you will be returned to the main menu.</p>

<p>If an Actual load has been selected then a record will be inserted into the relevant
history file for each member in the batch, and, in the case of a contribution batch,
update the contribution totals for each member.</p>

<p>When the posting has finished, you will be returned to the batch file main menu.</p>

<h2><a name="Undo Batch Details"></a>Undo Batch Details</h2>

<p>Click Undo. This option allows you to undo a posted batch of history details to each
members record. The undo option results in the history details being removed, so please
ensure that this is what you want to happen before using this option.</p>

<p>The members to have their history records removed are the same selected members used
in the posted batch. This saves the user from re-entering the selection details.</p>

<p>On selecting this option, the following window is displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/pem_bat11.jpg" alt="All details will be removed" /></p>

</div>

<p>Click ‘Yes’ to continue with the undo process. Click ‘No’ to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>A report is produced listing all the history records to be removed, and any records
which wil not be removed due to the record not existing. In the case of Contribution
History, the contribution may have already been allocated either on or after the date
due. In this case the record cannot be removed.</p>

<p>After viewing the report, you will be asked if you wish to continue and update the
database with the undo details. Click ‘Yes’ to complete the undo process, and to un-tick
the ‘Posted’ field. Click ‘No’ to return to the main menu.</p>

<h2><a name="Browse Batch Details"></a>Browse Batch Details</h2>
