<p>The Copy Members allows the user to copy a selection of members from one scheme to another. The user is able to select which parts of the member’s record they wish to copy over. All the program expects the user to do is select at least the Basic Member Details.</p>

<p>The following options and screen is displayed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

<p>Click ‘Copy’.</p>

<a name="pm_category"></a>
<a name="pm_status"></a>
<a name="psft_code"></a>
<a name="pm_member"></a><strong>SELECTION CRITERIA</strong> - Select the group of members you wish to copy using the Scheme, Company,
Category, Status, Special Code and Member fields (see <a href="/pm90/pension/appendices/app_b/">Selection Criteria</a>).
When the selection criteria have been entered click on ‘OK’ to proceed or click on
‘Cancel’ to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>Once the selection of members has been made, a popup window will appear so the user can enter where they wish to copy the members to.</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_memcopy2.jpg" alt="Copy Members To Window" /></p>

  <p>Copy Members To Window</p>
</div>

<p><a name="p_scheme"></a><strong>SCHEME</strong> - Enter the Scheme Code or select a code from
the lookup list. The code that is entered will be assigned as the scheme code for the selected members to copy.</p>

<p><a name="p_company"></a><strong>COMPANY</strong> - Enter a valid Company Code for the Scheme entered or select a code from the lookup list. The code that is entered will be assigned as the company code for the selected members to copy.</p>

<p><a name="p_category"></a><strong>CATEGORY</strong> - Enter a valid Category Code for the Scheme entered or select a code from the lookup list. The code that is entered will be assigned as the category code for the selected members to copy.</p>

<p>One the user has entered these codes a popup window will appear which will allow the user to select which areas of the member’s record they wish to copy.</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_memcopy3.jpg" alt="Select Data To Copy Window" /></p>

  <p>Select Data To Copy Window</p>
</div>

<p>The areas of data that are available to the user to copy are dependant on a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the scheme, the user is copying members from, is the same as the scheme, the user is copying members to, then all the User Defined Screens (UDS) and User Defined Histories (UDH) will be available for them to copy. However, if the schemes are different then they will not be. This is because the UDS and UDH in the scheme being copied into may not be set up in the correct format as the way they are in the scheme copying from.</li>
  <li>Members Quotations will not be available to copy over, due to the necessity of needing the quotations and formulas to be set up in exactly the same way from one scheme/category to another.</li>
  <li>Members Switches will not be available to copy over, due to the complexity of the switches, especially of the switches have been created via the Bulk Switch program.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user must select at least one area of a member’s record to copy over, and the Basic Member Details must also be part of the data being copied over too. If either of these criterias are not met then the user will be warned of this and will not be allowed to proceed until they have been met.</p>

<p>Once the areas of the member’s record have been selected then click ‘OK’ to continue, or ‘Cancel’ to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>If there are no members selected from the criteria entered by the user, then the user will be informed of this and the program will return to the main menu. Also, if the scheme the user is trying to copy members into is flagged as a test scheme, then the program will check that the number of members already held in that scheme, plus the number of members the user is trying to copy doesn’t exceed 10. If it does then the user will be informed of this and the program will return to the main menu.</p>

<p>A report will now be produced out to Excel listing the members that have been selected to be copied. The user will now be asked if they wish to continue with the copying of these members. Click ‘Yes’ to continue, or ‘No’ to return to the main menu.</p>

<p>The following screen will now be displayed that informs the user of the copying process.</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_memcopy4.jpg" alt="Copying Data Progress Screen" /></p>

  <p>Copying Data Progress Screen</p>
</div>

<p>Once all the data has been copied over, 1 or 2 more reports are produced out to Excel. The first one lists out the members that have been copied and the corresponding new member numbers for each of these members. The second one will be a Code Setup Report.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>The Code Setup report is only created if the scheme the user is copying members into is different to the scheme they are copying the members from, and areas such as Special Codes, Deferred Pensioner, Pensioner, Contribution History, Investment History etc have been selected to copy. In order for these areas of data to be displayed correctly to the screens in Members, the associated codes such as Special codes, Deferred Pensioner codes, Pensioner codes, Contribution codes, Investment Funds etc are needed to be set up in the scheme being copied into. If they are not already existing on the scheme then this report is produced to inform the user to set them up now.</p>
