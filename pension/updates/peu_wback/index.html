<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This program allows you to writeback (and optionally finalise) the results for any
quotation run on Pension Master. The data is written to that members exit screens
or to that members user defined screens. You can also use the Undo option to reverse
(and optionally un-finalise) a writeback that you have previously done.</p>

<p>The term ‘finalise’ means to tick the finalised field on the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Running Benefit Quotations/Calculations">members
quotation results</a> and to update the members <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#pm_status">status
code</a> to the new specified status code. Additionally, if the member’s status code
is changing from an active code to a non-active code, the members <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#pm_dtlft">date
left</a> is also updated.</p>

<p>This has the effect of locking that quotation type for the member as Pension Master
will not allow you to re-run finalised quotations. As an example, you might want to
finalise a quotation type if a member retires and you have run a final retirement
quote and written back the data to the members pensioner screens.</p>

<p>‘Un-finalise’ effectively reverses the finalise process described above.</p>

<p>The following options and screen appears when this program is selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#Run">Run</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Undo">Undo</a></li>
  <li><a href="#Exit">Exit</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_wback1.jpg" alt="Writeback Quote Results Screen" /></p>

  <p>Writeback Quote Results Screen</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="Run"></a>Run</h2>

<p>Click ‘Run’.</p>

<p>You will be asked if you wish to do a Provisional or an Actual run. A Provisional
run does all that an actual run does, but does not write any results to the database.</p>

<p><a name="pm_scheme"></a><a name="pm_company"></a><a name="pm_category"></a><a name="pm_status"></a><a name="psft_code"></a><strong>SELECTION
CRITERIA</strong> - Select the group of members you require to writeback quote results
for using the Scheme, Company, Category, Status, Special Code and Member Number fields
(see <a href="/pm90/pension/appendices/app_b/">Selection Criteria</a>). When the selection criteria have been entered
click ‘OK’ to proceed.</p>

<p>You can click ‘Cancel’ to return to the main menu and abort the writeback run.</p>

<p>The following screen is displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_wback2.jpg" alt="Quote Type Selection Screen" /></p>

  <p>Quote Type Selection Screen</p>
</div>

<p><a name="p_quote_type"></a><strong>QUOTATION TYPE</strong> - Enter the quotation type to write
quote results back for.</p>

<p><a name="p_quote_date"></a><strong>QUOTATION DATE</strong> - Enter the date for the quotes you
wish to write back.</p>

<p><a name="p_finalise"></a><strong>FINALISE QUOTES?</strong> - Check this if you want to also
finalise the specified quotation type for the selected group of members</p>

<p><a name="p_fin_status"></a><strong>FINALISED STATUS</strong> - This option is only applicable
if you have checked the Finalise Quotes? field and is used to specify the new status
code for all selected members for which the quotation is to be finalised.</p>

<p>If you are writing back results to the Lifetime/Annual Allowance screen for the selected members, then a popup window will appear which will prompt you to enter a year for the 5th April you wish to write the results back for. The popup window is as follows:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/peu_wback3.jpg" alt="Annual/Lifetime Allowance Date Screen" /></p>

  <p>Annual/Lifetime Allowance Date Screen</p>
</div>

<p>Pension Master then proceeds to write the appropriate quotation results to the specified
exit or user defined screens (as specified in <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_cat/#pqh_table">Category
File</a>) for each member selected. If successful and the <a href="#p_finalise">Finalise
Quotes?</a> option was checked, it also finalises any quotations for this quotation
type and selected group of members.</p>

<p>There are several situations that can cause exceptions:</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-12">

    <table class="table table-condensed">
      <tbody>
        <tr>

<p>If successful, a report detailing the proposed writebacks is displayed and can be
printed at this time.</p>

<p>If the writeback was un-successful, an exception report will be produced which details
the records that were rejected and the reason why. You must address each exception
before being able to writeback the quotation results successfully.</p>

<p>The options for printing are described in the document <a href="/pm90/pension/general/gn_printm/">Printing
From Pension Master</a>.</p>

<p>The system will then return to the main menu.</p>

<p>An undo quote writeback run deletes any records created by a quote writeback run as
set out above and brings the selected member records back to the situation immediately
before the actual quote writeback run was performed. It also un-finalises any quotations
for this quotation type and selected group of members.</p>

<p>Before the process deletes any data, a warning message is displayed informing you
of the data that is about to be deleted as per the above table. <strong>This is your final
chance to stop the process before any data is deleted.</strong></p>
