  <p>Only users who belong to a <a href="/pm90/pension/system_administration/gn_user_groups/">User Group</a> that has the correct permission can access this option.</p>

  <p>If you do not have permission, you will not be permitted access to this option.</p>
</div>

<p>This program allows maintenance of System Parameters. This contains details of any
system-wide variables that can be set for Pension Master.</p>

<p>The following options and screen appear when this program is selected:</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="Add a Record"></a>Add a Record</h2>

<h3><a name="1"></a><a name="Basic System Parameters"></a>Basic System Parameters</h3>

<p>Click ‘Add’. You cannot use the Add option if details already exist on the System
Parameter file. In this case you must use the query option first (see below).</p>

<p><a name="pp_name"></a><strong>System Company Name</strong> - Enter the full Company name.
This is used by Pension Master at the top of all the main menus. An entry must be
made in this field and the system will display an error message if this field is
left blank.</p>

<p><a name="pp_sname"></a><strong>Short Name</strong> - Enter a short name for the Company. This
is used at the top of all screens within Pension Master. An entry must be made in
this field and the system will display an error message if this field is left blank.
The user will then be required to enter the Company short name in this field.</p>

<p><a name="pp_addr1"></a><a name="pp_addr2"></a><a name="pp_addr3"></a><a name="pp_addr4">
</a><a name="pp_postcode"></a><strong>Address &amp; Postcode</strong> - Enter the address
and postcode of the Company. At least the first two lines of the Company address
must be entered and the system will display an error message if these fields are
left blank.</p>

<p><a name="pp_tel"></a><strong>Telephone Number</strong> - Enter the telephone number of the
Company (optional).</p>

<p><a name="pp_fax"></a><strong>Fax Number</strong> - Enter the fax number (if any) of the Company
(optional).</p>

<p><a name="pp_country"></a><strong>Country</strong> - Enter your country or click on lookup icon
and select it from the list. This is used to determine whether the first
field on the ‘Fund Restrictions’ screen of ‘<a href="/pm90/pension/investments/pem_invfun/">Investment Managers</a>’
is displayed as ‘Post 1997 Investment?” (UK) or “Post 1991 Investment?” (Ireland).</p>

<p><a name="pp_base"></a><strong>Default Base Currency</strong> - Select a Default Base Currency from the drop-down list
e.g. if your schemes are predominately UK based schemes, select ‘Pound Sterling’.</p>

<p><strong>At the end of the transitional period in the introduction of the Euro i.e. on 31/12/2001,
you should update this field to be ‘Euro’ i.e. make the system default base currency
the Euro.</strong></p>

<p>You will then be prompted that all <a href="/pm90/pension/system_data/pem_stf/">annual statutory amounts</a>
are to be converted from the NCU to Euro and that this process in not reversible.
You will be asked whether you have an up to date backup of the current system data
and if not, you will be given an opportunity to exit the change and take a backup.
Once this has been done, all annual statutory amounts will be converted
to Euro’s.</p>

<p>You should also make sure that each of your schemes has the scheme base currency
field in the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#Basic Scheme Details">Basic Scheme Details</a>
screen of <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#Basic Scheme Details">Schemes</a> set to ‘EUR’ at
this stage to ensure that all scheme and membership monetary data is converted into
Euro’s.</p>

<p><a name="pp_age_calc"></a><strong>Calculate</strong> - Select one of the following options from the drop-down list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Age Next Birthday</li>
  <li>Age Last Birthday</li>
</ul>

<p>This relates to the field pm_age in the member record which stores
the age for each member and can be used in formulae, reports and mail merged output
from Pension Master. The calculated age is displayed on the Basic Member Details
screen in <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Basic Member Details">Members</a>. It is dynamically
calculated each time you go into the Basic Member Details screen, add a member,
run a Member Report or Mail Merge Report or a formula that references this new field.</p>

<p>The way this is calculated differs on which program you are using as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Members - always calculate age at today’s date i.e. the system date.</li>
  <li>Member Report/Mail Merge Report - always calculate age at the report date.</li>
  <li>Formula File/Quotations - always calculate age at quotation date.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pp_server_ip"></a><strong>Web Server User Manual Address</strong> - Enter the URL
of the web-server on your network that contains the Pension Master User Manual. This
can either be in the format http://webserver/pendoc/ or the hostname of the server,
provided this is resolvable by all connected clients PC’s onto the correct IP address
of the Pension Master server. If your network doesn’t have a web-server then the
Pension Master User Manual folder should be held on the Pension Master server. The
folder should be accessible to all users via a drive mapping. This field should
then contain the drive mapping and the path to the folder e.g. M:\pendoc.</p>

<p>This is used by the Pension Master software to find the appropriate User Manual
page when the user clicks or selects the User Manual icon on their screen.</p>

<p><a name="pp_import_source"></a><strong>Import Source</strong> - The Import Source can either be set to Network Drive or Local Drive.</p>

<p>If the Import Source is set to Network Drive then a Network Drive Path can be entered for either General Data Load and Mail Merge. This can either be a drive mapping (e.g. L: or P:) or a network location (e.g. \PMSERV\dataloads). The folders would need to be set as shareable with the correct permissions for the Pension Master user account on the server. Contact L&amp;P Systems Limited for assistance.</p>

<p>The Network Drive Path could also be left blank if data is loaded from more than one location on the server. If the Import Source is set to Network Drive then the file that is entered as the Import File will be used for the data load. The Import File can be manually changed or selected from the data load folder using the file picker.</p>

<p>If the Import Source is set to Local Drive then General Data Load, allows the file to be selected manually from a folder using the browser each time.</p>

<p>When the System Parameter details have been entered click on ‘OK’ to save the details
to the system parameter file. You can click on ‘Cancel’ at any stage to exit the
add option without saving the details.</p>

<h3><a name="4"></a>Basic System Parameters 2</h3>

<p>Click ‘Update’.</p>

<p>Select the Basic System Parameters 2 screen as set out in the section <a href="#navigate">Navigating Between Screens</a> later in this section.</p>

<p>This screen allows you to set the order by which the member query displays the results
of a search. In addition it holds certain indicator fields which allows the user to
enable the following processes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Workflow</li>
  <li>Delete Quotation History</li>
  <li>Member Session Report</li>
  <li>Bulk Delete in Member File</li>
  <li>Include NI/RSI/PPS/TRN Numbers in Standard Reports</li>
</ul>

<p>The following screen is displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/pem_sysp2.jpg" alt="Basic Parameter Details 2 Screen" /></p>

  <p>Basic Parameter Details 2 Screen</p>
</div>

<p><a name="pp_sort1"></a><strong>Member Query Sort</strong> - Select the fields in the order
that you wish Pension Master to sort the member query results, e.g. Surname then
Forename will sort the members in alphabetical order of their surnames with sub-sorts
of their forenames:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Category Code</li>
  <li>Company Code</li>
  <li>Date of Birth</li>
  <li>Forename</li>
  <li>Member Number</li>
  <li>NI/PPS Number</li>
  <li>Scheme Code</li>
  <li>Staff Number</li>
  <li>Status Code</li>
  <li>Surname</li>
  <li>Title</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="pp_capitalise"></a><strong>Capitalise Names/Text Fields</strong> - This allows you to switch on the automatic
casing of certain fields. The field will default to casing these fields if ticked. If you wish your Pension
Master system not to do this, for example if you are an Irish site with Gaelic surnames,
you will have to untick the field. At present the following fields are supported:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title</li>
  <li>Forename</li>
  <li>Surname</li>
  <li>Job Title</li>
  <li>Member’s salutation</li>
  <li>Full forenames</li>
  <li>Address Lines</li>
</ul>

<p>If you tick this field, a prompt will be displayed asking if you really
wish to change it as this will result in Pension Master automatically re-casing
the above fields for each member record on the system. You will then be prompted
again to ask if you really are sure that you wish to do this. This acts as a security
procedure as <strong>it will not be possible to un-case the above fields for each member
once you have indicated that you wish the casing to apply.</strong> To change back
to un-cased fields, you will manually have to amend each members record, one by
one, which may take a long time, or alternatively, restore a backup of your system
data taken prior to you changing the casing flag. <strong>You should thus change this field
only if you are sure this is what you want to do and are aware that the process
is not reversible other than by a lengthy manual procedure or by restoring a system backup.</strong></p>

<p><a name="pp_workflow"></a><strong>Use Workflow</strong> - This field denotes whether you wish
to disable the workflow features in Pension Master. To enable workflow, make sure
this field is checked (i.e. shows a tick in it). To disable workflow, make sure
this field is not checked.</p>

<p><a name="pp_del_quote"></a><strong>Delete Quotation History</strong> - This field denotes
whether you wish to delete member’s quotation history details. To enable deletion,
make sure this field is ticked. To disable deletion, make sure this field is not
ticked.</p>

<p><a name="pp_del_months"></a><strong>After n Months Old</strong> - This field denotes the number
of months old the quotation history details must be before they will be deleted.
A minimum of 1 month old is required. This field works in conjunction with the ‘Delete
Quotation History’ field. If the ‘Delete Quotation History’ field is ticked then
this field must be entered. If the ‘Delete Quotation History’ field is un-ticked
then this field must be left blank.</p>

<p><a name="pp_sess_rep"></a><strong>Run Member Session Report</strong> - This field denotes whether
you wish to disable the member session report features in Pension Master. To enable the
member session report, make sure this field is checked (i.e. shows a tick in it). To
disable the member session report, make sure this field is not checked.</p>

<p><a name="pp_bulk_del"></a><strong>Allow Bulk Delete In Members File</strong> - This field denotes
whether you wish to disable the bulk delete option in the Members file. To enable bulk
delete, make sure this field is checked (i.e. shows a tick in it). To disable bulk delete,
make sure this field is not checked.</p>

<p><a name="pp_nipps_rep"></a><strong>Include NI/RSI/PPS/TRN Numbers in Standard Reports</strong> - This field denotes
whether you wish to disable the displaying of the PPS Number in any of the standard reports delete option in the Members file. To enable, make sure this field is checked (i.e. shows a tick in it). To disable bulk delete,
make sure this field is checked.</p>

<p><a name="pp_internet_encryption"></a><strong>Internet Security Details Encryption</strong> - This option encrypts the following fields on the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/#Internet Security Details">Internet Security Details</a> screen in Members using either no encryption, MD5 or SHA-2:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mother’s Maiden Name</li>
  <li>Place of Birth</li>
  <li>First School</li>
  <li>Memorable Word</li>
</ul>

<p>This process <strong>cannot</strong> be reversed and should only be selected after consultation with L&amp;P Systems Limited.</p>

<p><a name="pp_purge_trash"></a><strong>Number of Days to Keep Trash</strong> - This option allows you to set the number of days that the application should keep the generated reports, spreadsheets and files that have been created by Pension Master. The default is 30 days.</p>

<p>This screen allows you to set various criteria that are used by the <a href="/pm90/pension/general/gn_logon/">
logon screen</a> of Pension Master.</p>

<p>The following screen is displayed:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/pem_sysp4.jpg" alt="Password Option Details Screen" /></p>

<p><a name="pp_pass1"></a><strong>Minimum Password Length</strong> - This field is used to set
a minimum length for passwords that a user may select using the <a href="/pm90/pension/general/gn_logon/">
logon screen</a> of Pension Master. If you do not wish to set a minimum password
length, set this field to 0. Otherwise, enter an the minimum length to be used e.g. 6.</p>

<p><a name="pp_pass2"></a><strong>Must Contain Numbers As Well As Characters</strong> - This
field is used to ensure that any password a user chooses contains a mixture of numbers
as well as characters. This gives Pension Master an extra level of security
as it is likely that passwords containing both letters and numbers will be harder
to guess than those just containing letters. If this field is ticked then any
password a user chooses must contain at least one of the characters a-z (case insensitive)
and at least one of the numbers 0-9.</p>

<p><a name="pp_pass3"></a><strong>Days Allowed Between Password Changes</strong> - This sets
how frequently the user is forced to change their password e.g. if you set this
field to 30, the user will be forced to change their password every 30 days. If
you do not wish to force password changes in this way, set this field to 0.</p>

<p><a name="pp_pass4"></a><strong>Password History</strong> - Set this field to a valid number
X, where X denotes to number of passwords to keep in the password history file.
This controls the number of new passwords that must be used by a user before an
old password can be re-used e.g. if this is set to 3, every time a user changes
their password, they must choose a new password that is not the same as any of the
last three passwords used. If you do not wish to check password uniqueness in this
way, set this field to 0.</p>

<p><a name="pp_pass5"></a><strong>Limit User To One Concurrent Session</strong> - This field
allows you to specify that each user can only log onto Pension Master once at any
one point in time.</p>

<p><a name="pp_pass6"></a><strong>Password Required</strong> - This field allows you to specify
if a user has to choose a password to log in to Pension Master. If this field is
ticked then a user may log in to Pension Master without supplying a password,
otherwise the user will be prompted for a password at login and will not be permitted
access to Pension Master without first supplying a non-blank password.</p>

<p><a name="pp_password_encryption"></a><strong>Password Encryption</strong> - This field allows the following fields to be encrypted using the more secure SHA-2 instead of MD5: User Passwords, the Internet Password on the Internet Security Details page in Members and Password Settings in Payroll Master.</p>
