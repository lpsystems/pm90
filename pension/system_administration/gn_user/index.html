<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>Only users who belong to a <a href="/pm90/pension/system_administration/gn_user_groups/">User Group</a> that has the correct permission can access this option.</p>

  <p>If you do not have permission, you will not be permitted access to this option.</p>
</div>

<p>This program allows maintenance of the User file. This allows the System Administrator
to control who is allowed access to Pension Master and what options they can access
e.g. they can set a user up so that they do not have access to the more sensitive
areas of the system like Formulae.</p>

<p>The following options and screen appear when this program is selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add</li>
  <li>Query</li>
  <li>Update</li>
  <li>Delete</li>
  <li>Report</li>
  <li>Password</li>
  <li>Menu</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/gn_user1.jpg" alt="User File - Screen 1" /></p>

  <p>User File - Screen 1</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="Add a User"></a>Add a User</h2>

<h3><a name="1"></a><a name="Basic User Details"></a>Basic User Details</h3>

<p>Click ‘Add’.</p>

<p>You will be asked if you want to copy the user from another user on the database. Doing that will allow you to update users with the same access to menu’s and schemes.</p>

<p><a name="user_id"></a><strong>USER ID</strong> - Enter the User ID. This must consist of alphanumeric characters only.</p>

<p>A User ID of ‘intranet’ cannot be used. This is reserved for members of a Company
Pension Scheme that have accessed their own information via the Company’s intranet.</p>

<p><a name="user_name"></a><strong>USER NAME</strong> - Enter the full name of the user. This can
be used when printing off standard letters. An entry must be made in this field.</p>

<p><a name="user_title"></a><strong>JOB TITLE</strong> - Enter the user’s job title. This can be
used when printing off standard letters.</p>

<p><a name="user_wrkgrp"></a><strong>WORKGROUP</strong> - Enter the user’s workgroup or leave blank
if you do not wish to assign this user to a workgroup. See the <a href="/pm90/pension/system_administration/gn_wrkgrp/">Workgroups</a> option.
If you are unsure of the workgroups currently set up on your Pension Master
system, click on the lookup icon to see a list of Workgroups.</p>

<p><a name="passwd_changed"></a><strong>DATE PASSWORD LAST CHANGED</strong> - This is a display
only field and shows the date the user last changed their password. This can give
the System Administrator an indication of when the user will next be required to change
their password if password expiration controls in <a href="/pm90/pension/system_administration/pem_sysp/#Password Option Details">System
Parameters</a> are set.</p>

<p><a name="force_change"></a><strong>FORCE PASSWORD CHANGE NEXT LOGIN</strong> - You can use this
field to force the user to change their password the next time they logon to Pension
Master via the<a href="/pm90/pension/general/gn_logon/"> logon screen</a>.</p>

<p><a name="user_security"></a><strong>SECURITY LEVEL</strong> - Enter a security level for your
user. This is used in conjunction with the security levels on each scheme record and
each member record to determine if the user has access to that record. E.g. if a user
has a security level of 99 and a scheme, screen or member record has a security level
of 1 or 50, then the user will not be allowed access to that scheme/member record.</p>

<p>The valid security ratings are any number in the range 1 to 99, with 1 being the highest
security level and 99 being the lowest. If you are unsure of the security levels that
are available on your system, click on the lookup icon to see a list. See the
<a href="/pm90/pension/system_data/pem_sec/">Security Levels</a> option.</p>

<p><a name="user_sysadm"></a><strong>USER GROUP</strong> - This determines what parts of the system the user has access too. Exact details of how this works can be found in the <a href="/pm90/pension/system_administration/gn_user_groups/">User Group</a> option.</p>

<p><a name="user_update"></a><strong>UPDATE MEMBER RECORDS</strong> - This determines whether you wish to allow the current user to add/update/delete
member records in <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_mem/">Members</a>.</p>

<p><a name="user_favourites"></a><strong>AUTOMATICALLY EXPAND FAVOURITES</strong> - This determines if the user is automatically presented with their
favourites menu rather then the normal Pension Master menus when they log in.</p>

<p><a name="user_deletembrs"></a><strong>DELETE MEMBER RECORDS</strong> -If “Delete Member Records” is set to “No” then Bulk Delete will not be a menu option in the Basic Member Details screen.</p>

<p><a name="user_Internetad"></a><strong>INTERNET ADMINISTRATOR</strong> - Used by Pension Master Online in order to control access to the administration section of Pension Master Online Portal.</p>

<p>When the first screen of user details have been entered click on ‘OK’ to save the
details to the user file. You can click on ‘Cancel’ at any stage to exit the add option
without saving the details.</p>

<h3><a name="2"></a><a name="Menu Option Details"></a>Menu Option Details</h3>

<p>When the first screen of details has been saved the second screen of user details
is automatically displayed. This allows you to set up the menu options that will be
available for this user.</p>

<p><strong>Pension Master will default to allow all menu options with a ‘PE’ in the first
column of the screen i.e. all pension related menu options. It will also default to
allow access to the ‘Main Menu’ and ‘Diary Entry’ menu options.</strong></p>

<p>The second screen of user details is as follows:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/gn_user2.jpg" alt="User File - Screen 2" /></p>

  <p>User File - Screen 2</p>
</div>

<p>This screen is where you setup which of the standard Pension Master menu items will
be available to the current user. If you untick the Access field the corresponding
menu item will not be displayed when the user uses Pension Master. In this way, you
can effectively and quickly restrict acces to only those menu items a user need to
do their job.</p>

<p>All available menu titles and menu options are displayed to the screen. Tick or untick the Access field
depending on whether you wish this user to have access to this menu/menu option or not.</p>

<p>When the second screen of user details have been entered click on ‘OK’ to save the
details to the user file. You can click on ‘Cancel’ at any stage to exit the add option
without saving the details.</p>

<h3><a name="3"></a><a name="User Access Details"></a>User Access Details</h3>

<p>When the second screen of details has been saved the third screen of user details
is automatically displayed. This allows you to set up the scheme access options that
will be available for this user.</p>

<p>The third screen of user details is as follows:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/pension/images/gn_user3.jpg" alt="User File - Screen 3" /></p>

  <p>User File - Screen 3</p>
</div>

<p>This screen is where you can define which schemes this user has access to. This can
be done at three different levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>All users have access to the scheme. This option is set via the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#User Access Details">User
Access Details</a> screen in Schemes.</li>
  <li>All members of a particular workgroup have access to the scheme. See <a href="/pm90/pension/system_administration/gn_wrkgrp/">Workgroups</a>.
This option is set via the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#User Access Details">User Access
Details</a> screen in Schemes.</li>
  <li>User level access. Here you define particular users via their user ID so as to restrict
access to a scheme. You can set this option either using this screen or via the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#User Access Details">User
Access Details</a> screen in Schemes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To see who is allowed access to a particular scheme, see the <a href="/pm90/pension/file_maintenance/pem_sch/#User Access Details">User
Access Details</a> screen in Schemes.</p>

<p>Amend the details for user access as appropriate.</p>

<p>The last column on the screen indicates what type of access level that line refers
to. It takes the values ‘A’ (for all), ‘W’ (for workgroup) or ‘U’ (for user) corresponding
to each of the levels outlined above respectively.</p>

<p>Click on ‘Add Row’ to insert a line and click on ‘Delete Row’ to delete the current
line of details. Click on ‘Next Record’ to scroll down the screen or click on ‘Prev
Record’ to scroll up the screen.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
  <p>If you delete a line of data by clicking on ‘Delete Row’, that line will only be
removed from the database if the last column is equal to ‘U’ i.e. user level security
access. Otherwise, the line will be removed from the screen, but will re-appear once
you click on ‘OK’ to save the details.</p>
</div>

<p>When the third screen of user details have been entered click on ‘OK’ to save the
details to the user file. You can click on ‘Cancel’ at any stage to exit the add option
without saving the details.</p>

<p>You will be returned to the main menu.</p>

<h2><a name="Query/Search For A User"></a>Query/Search For A User</h2>

an error message is displayed.</p>

<h2><a name="Update A Users Record"></a>Update A Users Record</h2>

<p>Before Updating, a record must be selected through the query option, and an error
message is displayed if a record for update has not been selected.</p>

<p>Click ‘Update’.</p>

<p>The User ID field cannot be changed as this is the key to the user file. When the
changes have been made to the record click on ‘OK’ to save the changes to file, or
click on ‘Cancel’ to exit the update option without saving changes.</p>

<h2><a name="Delete A User Record"></a>Delete A User Record</h2>

<p>Before Deleting, a record must be selected through the query option, and an error
