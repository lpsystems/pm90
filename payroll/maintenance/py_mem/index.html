<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This program allows maintenance of the Member file. This is where you will find
data relating to a member’s pension details. The data is accessed via a series of
screens, each grouping together similar parts of the member’s pension data. To navigate
between the screens in the Member File, click ‘Menu’. The menu option is described
in more detail later in this section. You are not able to Add new members in this
program. This must be done through the Member File in Pension Master.</p>

<p>The different screens of information that you will find in the Member File are as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Member’s Personal Details</li>
  <li>Member’s Pension Details</li>
  <li>Member’s Year To Date Details</li>
  <li>Member’s Bank Details</li>
  <li>Member’s History Details</li>
  <li>Member’s Pay Element Details</li>
</ul>

<p>The following options and screen appear when this program is selected.</p>

</div>

<p>You may select records by using the Member Number, Member Forename, Member Surname,
Scheme Code, Company Code, Category Code, Status Code, NI/PRSI Number, Staff Number,
Sex, Marital Status, Date of Birth fields. You may also use any combination (or
even partial combination) of these fields to select the required member(s). See

<p>Once you have entered your selection criteria, click ‘OK’ to proceed and retrieve
the records from the database or click ‘Cancel’ to abort the selection and return
to the Members main menu.</p>

<p>If more than one record is found to match your search criteria, the following screen
is displayed:</p>

displayed directly to the screen.</p>

<p>A message is then displayed to the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p><a name="pym_start"></a><strong>START</strong>

If this field is left blank then it will be assumed that the pay element is active and should be processed so long as either the End date is blank or the End date is after the payroll date. If a date is entered then it must be on or before the End date, if an End date is also entered.</p>

<p><a name="pym_end"></a><strong>END</strong>

code is allocated to the member. This field is updated by the payroll run program
