<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This program allows the user to run a payroll for a specified scheme. From this
program the user can print the payslips and payment summary reports for the members
of the scheme.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

  <p>Only users set up as a System Administrator can access this program.</p>

  <p>If another user is running either the Backup Data program, the Restore Data program,
or the Year End program, then you are unable to process the Payroll Run until the
other program has completed.</p>

</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

  <p>There must be Government Legislation details set up for the tax year, you wish to
run the Payroll in. If there isn’t, then the user will be informed of this when
they attempt to run a payroll.</p>

  <p>The user will be allowed to use the previous tax year’s Government Legislation details,
however, they must update the Government Legislation program with the new tax year
details as soon as they receive them.</p>

</div>

<p>The following options and screen appear when this program is selected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run</li>
  <li>Submit</li>
  <li>Exit</li>
</ul>

<div class="screen">

<p><a name="pm_scheme"></a><strong>SCHEME CODE</strong>
- Enter the scheme code required. To get a list of valid scheme codes click on the lookup icon.
When a valid scheme code has been entered the scheme description will be displayed.
This field must be entered.</p>

<p><a name="pm_category"></a><strong>CATEGORY CODE</strong>
- Enter the category code required. To get a list of valid category codes click on the lookup icon.
When a valid category code has been entered the category description will be displayed.
This field should be left blank if you wish to run the payroll for every category of the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="run_date"></a><strong>RUN DATE</strong> - Enter the run date of the backup in the
format dd/mm/yyyy or ddmmyyyy. This field is defaulted as today’s date, however,
this can be altered to another date. Click on the calendar icon to display a calendar on
the screen. This field must be entered.</p>

<p>Click ‘OK’ to proceed with the payroll run. You can click ‘Cancel’ to return to
the payroll menu.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

  <p>If the run date entered is before the date of the last payroll run, an error message
will be displayed informing the user that there are no members ready for payroll
together with the date the payroll was last run. They will then be asked to input
a different date in the run date field.</p>

</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

  <p>If the run date entered falls inside a new tax year and the last run date falls
in the previous tax year, Payroll Master checks if the <a href="/pm90/payroll/payroll_procedures/py_yend/#Introduction">
Year End</a> procedure has been carried out. If it hasn’t then the user is informed
of this and they will not be allowed to continue with the payroll until the year
end procedure has been completed.</p>

</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

  <p>If the scheme pays their members in advance then members whose date pension commenced is after the run date entered, but before the next payroll run date, then they will be included in the current payroll run.</p>

</div>

<p>The following message is now displayed to the screen:</p>

<div class="well">

  <p>Do you wish to continue running the Payroll?</p>

</div>

<p>If ‘Yes’ is selected, then the payroll run will continue. If ‘No’ is selected,
then the program returns to the payroll menu.</p>

<h2><a name="Exceptions Report"></a>Exceptions Report</h2>

<p>When a payroll is run, all the members in the scheme must have all the information

<h3><a name="export"></a>Export Data for Mail Merge</h3>

<p>The member’s payslip data will now be exported out to a pipe delimitered file, which the user can then use in Mail Merge to print payslips using their own designed payslip layout.

<h3><a name="bulkpay"></a>Bulk Payment Report</h3>

<p>The bulk payment report will now be displayed to the screen. Further details of

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/payroll/images/py_pay4.jpg" alt="Select Report Options Window" /></p>

  <p>Select Report Options Window</p>
</div>

<p>If ‘Yes’ is selected then the program continues to commit the payroll data generated.
If ‘No’ is selected then the program returns back to the payroll menu.</p>

<h2><a name="bacs"></a>Creating a BACS Data File</h2>

<p>Members who run their payroll on Payroll Master can have their payment made
by BACS. In order for BACS to be used, a data file must be created to hold the payroll
data of the members.</p>

<p>A data file is created by many data lines. On each of these lines there must be
a description of the payroll data which can be displayed on each member’s bank statement
once they have been paid. This would usually be the name of the scheme who is paying
the members, however, the description entered is solely down to the user. The description
is held in the Bank Details screen of Schemes, and can only be up to 18 characters
long.</p>

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

  <p>The data file created through Payroll Master is made up from data lines. Each data
line consists of the following data: Sort Code, Account Number, Account Name, Amount,
Building Society Roll Number, Description.</p>

  <p>For example, ‘64466615498325MR D M LANG 5000000000000000000000L&amp;P SYSTEMS LTD’</p>

</div>

<h2><a name="chq"></a>Creating a Cheque Report</h2>

<p>Members who run their payroll on Payroll Master can have their payment made by manual
cheque. To inform the user of which members are to be paid by cheque, a Cheque Report
will be generated during the Payroll Run, which can then be accessed through the
Cheque Listing Report program.</p>

<p>Once the Payroll Run has been successfully completed, the following window pops
up:</p>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/payroll/images/py_pay7.jpg" alt="BACS Data File Successful Window" /></p>

  <p>BACS Data File Successful Window</p>
</div>

<p>It is now left to the user to use the recommended WinBACS Software to transfer the
BACS data file containing payroll data. Any manual cheques which need to be written
out will also be left to the user.</p>

<h2><a name="backup"></a>Backup of Payroll Data</h2>

<p>The Payroll Run program automatically creates backups of the Scheme’s payroll data.</p>

<p>These backups are done before and after records are written to the database, and only once the user has confirmed the payroll run. The two backups have descriptions of ‘Pre Payroll dd/mm/yyyy’ and ‘Post Payroll dd/mm/yyyy’ where dd/mm/yyyy is the Run Date.</p>

<h2><a name="submit"></a>Submit</h2>

<div class="screen">
  <p><img src="/pm90/payroll/images/py_paysub.jpg" alt="Submit File" /></p>

  <p>Submit File</p>
</div>

<p>You will run the payroll through the same ‘Payroll Run’ program. Once the payroll run has completed you will then use the ‘Submit’ menu option.</p>

<p>Selecting the ‘Submit’ menu option will open up a new screen where you will enter the Scheme Code, Category Code (if applicable) and Run Date. It is important that you enter the Scheme, Category and Run Date exactly as you did for the payroll run itself. The Sender, Accounts Office Reference and Gateway ID will auto-populate from the information held in the RTI Details screen in Payroll Schemes for the scheme. You will need to enter the Password that has been provided by HMRC.</p>

<p><strong>Final Submission For Year?</strong> - If this is the last payroll payment of the tax year then tick this check box.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring Scheme?</strong> - This field should only be selected under the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You (the client) are transferring the scheme to another provider and are therefore no longer running the payroll.</li>
  <li>The PAYE tax reference for the scheme <strong>is changing</strong> during the take over process.</li>
</ul>

<p>N.B. If the PAYE tax reference is staying the same for the scheme once its transferred to the new provider, then this option should not be used.</p>

<p>When this field is selected all payroll members within the scheme must have the Date Finished Pension and Last Payment fields filled in, and it’s only members with a Last Payment field ticked that are picked up.</p>

<p>When you know you are transferring a scheme you must do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run the last payroll as normal.</li>
  <li>Fill in the Date Finished Pension and tick the Last Payment field on every member of the scheme’s record.</li>
  <li>Go to the ‘Submit’ option in Payroll Run and fill in all the details making sure the ‘Transferring Scheme?’ field is ticked then click ‘OK’.</li>
</ul>

<p>N.B. It is important that the final FPS (Transferring Scheme submission) is submitted to HMRC before the new provider submits their first FPS.</p>

<p><strong>Scheme Ceased?</strong> - This field should be selected when you (the client) are closing down a scheme. When this field is ticked, it automatically ticks the ‘Final Submission For Year?’ field as well. This is done to ensure all the relevant information is sent to HMRC telling them that this scheme has finished and no more payroll will be run on it.</p>

<p>When you know you are closing a scheme down you must do the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure all members of the payroll scheme have had their Date Finished Pension field filled in and Last Payment field ticked in the Pension screen in Payroll Members.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the Date Scheme Ceased field is filled in in the Scheme Details screen in Payroll Schemes. The Date Scheme Ceased cannot be in the future and it must also be within the current tax year. If it’s not then you will be warned of this at the point of doing the submission.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reason for Late Submission</strong> - This field should only be selected when you (the client) are submitting an FPS after the Run Date. You will only be allowed access to this field if the Run Date is before today’s date.</p>

<p>The option available in this field is ‘Reasonable Excuse’, and by using this option it attaches the LateReason element to each member of the submission in the FPS file. If you are submitting an FPS late to HMRC then you should use this option. This option should be selected with caution as HMRC might require you to provide evidence of what your ‘Reasonable excuse’ is at a later date.</p>

  <p>The Payroll Run doesn’t pick up members whose Date Finished Pension is before the Payroll Run Date, however, the Submit option in the Payroll Run does pick up extra members who have their Last Payment field ticked. When a leaver is picked up only the members figures to date will be sent along with the leaving date. Once the submission has been successful the Last Payment indicator will be unticked.</p>

</div>

<p>On clicking ‘OK’ the program will generate an XML file which will then be sent to HMRC.</p>

<p>After the XML file has been sent to HMRC you will receive a confirmation message. This only indicates that HMRC have received the submission and not that the data is valid and has been accepted.</p>

<p>The program then waits for 20 seconds, a time limit imposed by HMRC, before checking your submission. The response will either be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A report will be produced if errors have been found. Any errors will need to be rectified and the scheme data submitted and checked again.</li>
  <li>A message saying ‘The submission has been acknowledged by the Government Gateway’ indicates that HMRC have received your request and are currently processing the data submission.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are running payroll for multiple Scheme and Scheme/Category combinations then it is important that you keep track of the stages that have been completed.</p>
